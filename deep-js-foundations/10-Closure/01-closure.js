/* Closure 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

/*
What is closure? Closure is when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.
