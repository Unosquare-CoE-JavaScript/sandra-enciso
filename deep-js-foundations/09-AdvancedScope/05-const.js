/*
Const
Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutableâ€”just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. 
For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.

//Is prefer to use const only for primitive values, because if you use it with objects, maybe don't works as you expected:
//Kyle says: Use var by default, use let if is useful and use const only for primitive values
var teacher = "Suzy";
teacher = "Kyle";

const myTeacher = teacher;
myTeacher = "Suzy"; //ypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const teachers = ["Kyle", "Suzy"];
teachers[1] = "Brian"; //Allowed!
