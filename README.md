This repository shows my continuous learning participating at center of excellence.
In the last few months I have been reinforcing my programming knowledge and developing new skills which improve my work as software developer.

## About me

My name is Sandra Enciso, Im a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience. I'm very organized and I keep my tasks well-defined every day. I also like to learn well-established technologies and frameworks and become specialized in them once they become a part of my daily job. I’m proactive and I like to participate in discussions and provide ideas and solutions for the problems at hand. I would like to become a lead so I can help my fellows in their professional growth.
