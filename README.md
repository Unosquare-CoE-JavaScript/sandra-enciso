This repository shows my continuous learning participating at the Center of Excellence.

In the last few months, I have been reinforcing my programming knowledge and developing new skills that improve my performance as a software developer.

## About me

My name is Sandra Enciso, I’m a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience. I'm very organized and I keep my tasks well-defined every day. I also like to learn well-established technologies and frameworks more specifically to develop myself in them once they become a part of my daily job. I’m proactive and I’m always open to dialogue, providing ideas and solutions for imminent problems. One of my goals is to become a leader so I could have the chance to help my co-workers with their professional growth.
